## About
A simple webpage made during the foundations course on the Odin Project.

I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Alongside, I was able to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Most importantly, I was able to organize "beginner friendly" clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer.
