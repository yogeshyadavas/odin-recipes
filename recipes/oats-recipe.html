    <h1>Oats Recipe</h1>
    <p>
      Do oats increase weight? Yes, they do if a recipe includes a few
      ingredients that can help in healthy weight gain.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of whole milk</li>
      <li>Oats(3 Spoons)</li>
      <li>Yoghurt(3 Spoons)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping options:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Nuts</li>
      <li>Blueberries</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
      <li>Raisins</li>
      <li>Almonds</li>
      <li>Penut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make it?</h3>
    <p>
      Blend oats with milk and yoghurt. Top it with fruits, dried fruits, and
      nuts like walnuts, almonds, and more to add healthy, high-calorie
      ingredients while limiting the sugar intake. This helps in increasing the
      extra calories while imparting a myriad of health benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are fond of shakes, weight gain becomes even more enjoyable. You
      can blend a glass of full cream milk, one banana, 75-100 gms of oats and
      whey protein powder (1-2 scoops, optional) and have it as breakfast or
      when on the go.
